# Exercise: Annotations 1
* define a class `Car` that has:
  * 2 instance variables `modelName` and `mileage`
  * a constructor that takes 2 params and assign them to the instance variables
  * a deprecated method (use an annotation to highlight it) `printCarDetails()` that:
    * prints on one line the car details
  * a new method called `getCarDetails()` that:
    * prints on multiple lines the car details
* define a tester class where you:
  * create a `Car` object
  * call both methods, suppressing deprecation warnings
